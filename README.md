# ðŸŽ² Random Team Generator

A small web app that takes a list of player names and randomly splits them into **Red** and **Blue** teams.  
Built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** â€” no frameworks required.

## âœ¨ What I Learned
- DOM manipulation (`document.querySelector`, `appendChild`)  
- Handling events (`onclick`, `keydown`)  
- Random assignment logic with balance (ensuring fair team sizes)  
- Dynamically creating/deleting HTML elements from JavaScript  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Notes
- Players are stored only in memory; refreshing clears the list.  
- Email functionality generates a `mailto:` link with team assignments pre-filled.
